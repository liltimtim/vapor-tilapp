# Sibling Relationships

**sibling relationships**: describe a relationship that links two models to each other. They are also known as **many-to-many** relationships. Unlike parent-child relationships, there are no constraints between models.

As an example, if you had a `Toy` object and a `Dog` object, their relationship could be that a dog can play with many toys and a toy can be played with by many dogs however they can independently exist without the other.
